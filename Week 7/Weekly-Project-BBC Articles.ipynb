In reality, it's not this simple. To be effective, one needs to organize the work very well. In this notebook, we will walkthrough practical aspects of a ML project. To look at the big picture, let's start with a checklist below. It should work reasonably well for most ML projects, but make sure to adapt it to your needs:\n","\n","1. **Define the scope of work and objective**\n","    * How is your solution be used?\n","    * How should performance be measured? Are there any contraints?\n","    * How would the problem be solved manually?\n","    * List the available assumptions, and verify if possible.\n","    \n","    \n","2. **Get the data**\n","    * Document where you can get that data\n","    * Store data in a workspace you can easily access\n","    * Convert the data to a format you can easily manipulate\n","    * Check the overview (size, type, sample, description, statistics)\n","    * Data cleaning\n","    \n","    \n","3. **EDA & Data transformation**\n","    * Study each attribute and its characteristics (missing values, type of distribution, usefulness)\n","    * Visualize the data\n","    * Study the correlations between attributes\n","    * Feature selection, Feature Engineering, Feature scaling\n","    * Write functions for all data transformations\n","    \n","    \n","4. **Train models**\n","    * Automate as much as possible\n","    * Train promising models quickly using standard parameters. Measure and compare their performance\n","    * Analyze the errors the models make\n","    * Shortlist the top three of five most promising models, preferring models that make different types of errors.\n","\n","\n","5. **Fine-tunning**\n","    * Treat data transformation choices as hyperparameters, expecially when you are not sure about them (e.g., replace missing values with zeros or with the median value)\n","    * Unless there are very few hyperparameter value to explore, prefer random search over grid search.\n","    * Try ensemble methods\n","    * Test your final model on the test set to estimate the generalizaiton error. Don't tweak your model again, you would start overfitting the test set."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ofeuKevOH5Ch"},"source":["## Example: Articles categorization"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"m2NSUqUEH5Ci"},"source":["### Objectives"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5GttlMG-H5Cj"},"source":["Build a model to determine the categories of articles.
